        const easyWinStrategies = {
            'repeated fraction addition': { tip: "Warm-up: Show students 3 groups of 2 apples. Ask for the multiplication equation (3 x 2 = 6). Then show 3 groups of 1/4 pizza slices. Ask for the multiplication equation (3 x 1/4 = 3/4). Connect the concepts directly." },
            'multiplication of decimals with addition': { tip: "Homework: Create a T-chart. On one side, solve 0.5 + 0.5. On the other, solve 0.5 x 0.5. Have students draw hundredths grids to model both problems to see the difference." },
            'reverses x and y': { tip: "Warm-up: Use the mnemonic 'You have to walk along the hall (x-axis) before you can go up the stairs (y-axis).' Have students plot 5 points, saying the mnemonic to themselves for each point." },
            'multiplying by 6': { tip: "Homework: Provide a 'y = 6x' table with some 'x' values and some 'y' values missing. Students must work forwards (multiplying) and backwards (dividing) to complete it." },
            'digits after the decimal': { tip: "Warm-up: Ask 'Which is worth more, 7 dimes or 12 pennies?' Connect this to comparing 0.7 and 0.12. Emphasize that the first digit after the decimal (tenths) is the most important." },
            'place value error during division': { tip: "Warm-up: 'About how many times does 30 go into 90?' (3). 'So, about how many times should 30 go into 97.5?' (A little more than 3). Use this estimation to check if the answer '32.5' or '3.25' makes more sense." },
            'congruent and parallel': { tip: "Homework: Give students a sheet with 4 shapes. Have them use a red crayon to trace all pairs of parallel sides and a blue crayon to mark all pairs of congruent sides." },
            'dots (players) instead of the values': { tip: "Warm-up: Show a simple dot plot. Ask two questions: 'How many players practiced for 4 hours?' (Answer is the number of dots). 'What is the range of practice times?' (Answer is subtracting values on the line). Discuss the difference." },
            'adds the dimensions': { tip: "Warm-up: Give students 12 sugar cubes. Ask them to build as many different rectangular prisms as they can and write down the dimensions for each (e.g., 2x2x3, 1x2x6). Reinforces that volume comes from multiplication." },
            'dividing a whole number by a fraction': { tip: "Homework: Ask students to draw a model for two problems: 'Share 6 cookies among 3 friends' (6 ÷ 3) and 'How many 1/3-size pieces can you cut from 6 cookies?' (6 ÷ 1/3). Compare the drawings and answers." },
            'subtracting only one width': { tip: "Warm-up: Draw a rectangle on the board with the perimeter and one side length given. Ask students to label ALL four side lengths before trying to solve for the missing length. This makes the 'two widths' concept visible." },
            'misplaces the decimal point': { tip: "Homework: Give students 5 multiplication problems with decimals. Their only task is to predict how many decimal places will be in the answer. Don't solve, just predict. (e.g., 1.2 x 1.23 -> 3 decimal places)." },
            'rounding numbers before subtracting': { tip: "Warm-up: Give a problem like 501 - 199. Have students solve it exactly, then solve it by rounding to the nearest hundred. Discuss why estimation is useful." },
            '"gross income" and "net income"': { tip: "Warm-up: Create a simple scenario: 'You earn $10 for chores (gross income). You have to give your parents $1 for supplies (deduction). How much is your take-home pay (net income)?'" },
            'visual representation of division': { tip: "Homework: Provide a hundredths grid representing 1.50. Ask students to circle 3 equal groups. 'What is the value of each group?' This visually reinforces division." },
            'x-axis, y-axis, x-coordinate': { tip: "Warm-up: Label a large coordinate plane in the classroom. Have students take turns standing at the 'origin', walking along the 'x-axis', and pointing to a specific 'y-coordinate'." },
            'order of operations (pemdas)': { tip: "Homework: Give students a multi-step expression and ask them to only circle the part they would do first, then pass the paper. The next student circles the next part. Continue until the expression is fully evaluated." },
            'prime and composite': { tip: "Warm-up: Give students a number like 12 and ask 'How many different ways can you multiply to get 12?' (1x12, 2x6, 3x4). Then give them 13 and ask the same question. Use this to define prime (only 1 way) and composite (more than 1 way)." },
            'fractions and decimals to add': { tip: "Warm-up: Use a number line with both fractions (e.g., 1/4, 1/2, 3/4) and decimals (0.25, 0.5, 0.75) marked. Ask students to match equivalent values before attempting any addition." },
            'rounding rules': { tip: "Homework: Create a number line from 124.5 to 124.6. Have students plot numbers like 124.55, 124.51, and 124.58 to visually see which end they are closer to." },
            'additive relationship': { tip: "Warm-up: Create two T-charts. One with the rule y = x + 5 and one with y = 5x. Have students fill out both and describe in words how the 'y' value changes in each table." },
            'part-whole relationship': { tip: "Warm-up: Use a simple bar model. 'A string is 10 inches long (whole). I cut off a 3-inch piece (part). What equation finds the leftover part?' (10 - 3 = z or 3 + z = 10)." },
            'distributive property': { tip: "Homework: Give students an expression like 5 x (10 + 2). Have them solve it two ways: using order of operations, and by 'distributing' (5x10 + 5x2). Discuss why both methods yield the same result." },
            'rounds the answer up instead of down': { tip: "Warm-up: Pose a simple problem: 'I have 10 cookies and want to give 3 cookies to each friend. How many friends can I *fully* give 3 cookies to?' Discuss why the answer is 3, not 3.33 or 4." },
            'default': { tip: "Review the vocabulary and steps for this type of problem. Work through one similar example together as a class, asking students to guide the process." }
